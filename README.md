# Custom FullScreen Button for React-Leaflet

This repository provides a custom fullscreen button control for the React-Leaflet map library. Developed with Vite, React, and Material UI, the fullscreen button enables users to toggle between fullscreen and windowed modes, enhancing the map interaction experience. The button's position can be dynamically adjusted (top-right, top-left, bottom-right, or bottom-left), providing flexibility to fit various map designs. Additionally, the button icon dynamically updates to indicate the current screen state, ensuring an intuitive user interface.
